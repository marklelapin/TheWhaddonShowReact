Ms Collin:	All right, listen up you lot. I’m your headteacher Ms Collin, I taught school for 20 years in the most deprived parts of the Northern Territories and don’t mean Stony Stratford so if you hard nuts from the Whaddon Hall Estate think you’re going to get one over me you’ve got another thing coming. Do you get me? Okay, let’s take the register. Charlene….Charlene….Charlene Calder I know you’re here.
Charlotte:		Do you mean Charlotte?
