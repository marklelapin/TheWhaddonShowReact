        // remote code execution vulnerabilities in backends like Django and Rails.
        // So we will disable the host check normally, but enable it if you have
        // specified the `proxy` setting. Finally, we let you override it if you
        // really know what you're doing with a special environment variable.

        // project directory is dangerous because we may expose sensitive files.
        // Instead, we establish a convention that only files in `public` directory
